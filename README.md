## Homework And Projects

### Submitting Homework And Projects

Homework and projects are submitted via Bootcampspot.


<details><summary><strong><u>Homework</u></strong></summary>

<br/>

You are allowed to skip up to 2 homeworks in Homework 1-20. Homework must recieve a grade higher than Incomplete to count towards your cert. 

Homeworks 21 and 22 are optional whether you skip other assignments or not.

For each homework, you are expected to make a new repository on Github unless otherwise noted in the instructions. Repositories should show frequent commits to help us see that you are using and learning git. 

<strong>Warning:</strong> Repositories with only 1 giant commit at the deadline are potential plagiarism flags, so it's best to commit early and often! Plus, you can easily revert to any previous commit in case things go awry, so don't worry about overwriting your work.

You can edit your homework after you've turned it in, but you should stop pushing commits to your repo at the deadline. Work edited after the deadline may not be seen by the grader.

Links to your homework's Github Website (i.e. https://github.com/yourUsername/yourHomeworkRepo) should be added to the appropriate coursework page on Bootcampspot. If you turn in your homework before the dealine, BCS will send it to Central Grading.

Grades are somewhat subjective depending on the grader, but typically standard at the letter-grade level. Check the provided rubrics to see how your scores are calculated, and bring any questions or concerns to your instructional team.

After your homework is graded, you can do anything you like with the repos. We recommend sprucing them up and showcasing your favorites on a portfolio page!
</details>

<details><summary><strong><u>Projects</u></strong></summary>
<br/>

For projects, all group members should submit the same links. All contributing group members will receive the same grade.

You are not allowed to skip any projects. In order to pass and recieve your cert, all projects must have a passing grade (D- or higher).

Submit the following links to BCS:

* A link to your presentation slides
* A link to your deployed website (does not apply to Project 1)
* <strong>Required</strong>: A link to your team's Github repository. All group members must make commits to your team repo.
* A link to your project writeup.

The non-required links are optional if you did not complete them. All team members should submit the same links.

With the exception of the final project, project presentations are not recorded.

</details>

<details><summary><strong><u>Late Homework</u></strong></summary>

<br/>

We recommend posting your link early to BCS early to avoid grading delays. You can even post it as soon as your make your repo!

If you add your link to BCS even a minute late, your homework will be considered late.

There is no grading penalty for late homework. However, late homework is not sent to Central Grading automatically - we have to manually request it. This can lead to grading delays.

To turn in your homework late, add your link to BCS as normal and contact your instructional staff (Sondra, TA1, TA2(?)) to request your homework be regraded.

Please turn in homework no later than 2 weeks before class ends. Grading delays near the end of class may delay your certificate.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you're behind or have questions. We're here for you, and our goal is your success!

### Regrading Homework And Projects

Submitted assignments are eligible for regrading until the end of class; however, we have limited resources, so requests must meet the criteria below to be considered.

<details><summary><strong><u>Homework</u></strong></summary>

<br/>

You can request a regrade on your homework if you have modified your homework based on the grader's feedback. We will not accept regrade requests if you have an A+; lower grades are eligible, but requests will be at the discretion of your instructional team. (We're generally pretty open to homework regrades though.)

Before requesting a regrade, write a short note explaining what you changed on Bootcampspot so the next grader understands why your work is being regraded. You must add this note to the BCS feedback thread for assignment.

To request your regrade, send a group slack message to Sondra, Bay, and Josh. You must leave a note on your BCS homework page first - we'll bounce the request back if you haven't.

</details>

<details><summary><strong><u>Projects</u></strong></summary>

<br/>

Project regrades can be requested by any **non**-ANP (active non-participatory) students. If you are no longer eligible for a certificate, you cannot request a regrade.

There is one case where we will guarantee a regrade:

> You received a failing grade (F or incomplete) on your project and have fixed your submission so it can pass. We will always regrade these requests.

Otherwise, regrades are at the discretion of the person who graded your project. Generally, we’re more likely to accept regrade requests if:

* You were missing major parts of the project that you needed to actually create (i.e. forgetting to write a report)
  <br/>OR
* You’ve made substantial changes based on our feedback.

If we’re too backed up on other tasks, regrading projects will need to wait.

If you’d like your project regraded, send us a request over slack explaining why and what you’ve changed.
